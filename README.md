# brailleplot
A colour graphics library for the Linux terminal using Braille dots as pixels.

## Examples

Compiling the project with `make`creates two executables: `pam2braille` and
`bplot`.

## Testing your terminal's colour modes

Run `make test` to create three executable programs to test the three colour
modes available in `brailleplot.h`.
